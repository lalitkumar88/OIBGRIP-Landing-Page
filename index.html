          <p>
            There are thousands of such heritage sites in India, whose structure
            is very strong. Many forts of Rajasthan have been converted into
            hotels equipped with modern facilities. In addition to being used as
            hotels or museums or libraries, buildings of this type can easily be
            adapted to be used as schools or clinics. The first step in this
            direction would be to ensure that visits to monuments and
            archaeological sites prove to be an exciting experience for the
            visitors. After decades of archaeological efforts, thousands of
            heritage sites have been discovered in India that are contemporary
            to the famous Harappan civilization. Very few people know about
            these places, while the tourism department has also failed to
            publicize the historical importance of these places, immediate
            effective steps will have to be taken in this direction. India has
            35 UNESCO-recognized World Heritage Sites, only a few countries in
            the world have more than 35.It is necessary to collect information
            about the music, food, rituals, dress, personality, sports,
            festivals etc. associated with these places so that we can make
            economic profit by giving these information to the visitors. The
            hardwork done by Sahyadri Foundation in Maharashtra is really nice,
            the nation now needs the NGO's like Sahyadri Foundation. Best luck
            for your future endeavours.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Various types of tasks done by Sahyadri Foundation is admirable.
            Continuous efforts for preserving the natural beauty of our state
            and hence this world is admirable. It would be unfortunate to say
            that till now we have been talking only on the social and cultural
            importance of our heritage sites, while their role in economic
            development is very important. If we want to take forward our
            heritage, then it has to be linked to economic benefits and for
            this, the cultural sector should be brought under the purview of
            liberalization, when these places become of economic importance,
            private and public sectors will be involved in their maintenance.
            This is one aspect that we have been ignoring.Today I, on behalf of
            our organization declare full support to Sahyadri Foundation.

          <p>
            The relation of a person to his heritage is like that of a child to
            his mother. Our heritage is our pride and it strengthens our sense
            of history. India has been a country whose history is full of
            diversity, from the Harappan civilization, the oldest in the world,
            where we can learn the best city-planning tricks, to the Jantar
            Mantar and observatories of Jaipur, we can see the glimpse of
            contemporary scientific development. The foundation stones of our
            art and culture are also our heritage sites.Tourism is the main
            vehicle of national development. Tourism is going to play an
            important role in making the ambitious Make in India initiative of
            the Government of India successful. To create employment for lakhs
            of young Indians, the country will have to grow at the rate of 9-10
            percent continuously for a few decades and to achieve this we will
            have to take advantage of our rich tourism resources. Sahyadri
            Foundation is a prominent organization in India which is dedicated
            to protection of forts in the state of Maharashtra. Group tasks done
            by them is really admirable and I wish a very best luck for thier
            future activities.
